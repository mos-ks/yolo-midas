# **PPE Dataset for Workplace Safety**

### Overview

The "PPE Dataset" is a robust and diverse collection of images designed for the development and enhancement of machine learning models in the realm of workplace safety. This dataset focuses on the detection and classification of various types of personal protective equipment (PPE) typically used in industrial and construction environments. The goal is to facilitate automated monitoring systems that ensure adherence to safety protocols, thereby contributing to the prevention of workplace accidents and injuries.

### Class Types
The dataset comprises annotated images spanning four primary PPE categories:

Boots: Safety footwear, including steel-toe and insulated boots.
Helmet: Various types of safety helmets and hard hats.
Person: Individuals, both with and without PPE, to enhance person detection alongside PPE recognition.
Vest: High-visibility vests, reflective safety gear for visibility in low-light conditions.
*Ear-protection*: adding images
*Mask*: Respiratory masks adding images
*Glass*: Safety glasses adding images
*Glove*: Safety Gloves adding images
*Safety cones*: to be added
Each class is meticulously annotated to provide precise bounding boxes, ensuring high-quality data for model training.


### Current Status and Timeline
Phase 1 - Collection: Gathering images from diverse sources, focusing on different environments, lighting conditions, and angles.
Phase 2 - Annotation: Ongoing process of labeling the images with accurate bounding boxes.
Phase 3 - Model Training: Scheduled to commence post-annotation, targeting advanced object detection models like YOLOv8 & YOLO-NAS.


### Contribution and Labeling Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the community! If you wish to contribute images or assist with annotations:

Image Contributions: Please ensure images are high-resolution and showcase clear instances of PPE usage. 
Annotation Guidelines: Follow the standard annotation format as per Roboflow's Annotation Guide.
Your contributions will play a vital role in enhancing workplace safety through AI-driven solutions.
